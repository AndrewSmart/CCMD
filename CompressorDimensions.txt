               Centrifugal Compressor Meanline Design

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The purpose of this tool is to test the design of a centrifugal compressor
operating in either non-ideal or ideal fluids.

                              USER MANUAL

1) Enter dimensions and operating conditions of the compressor.

2) Select the compressor components you wish to include by entering a 1 or 0
   where necessary.  I.e. if you would like to analyze the impeller only
   enter a value of ZERO for the "Diffuser Analyis" and "Volute Analysis" inputs.
   
3) Use the "Compressor Preliminary Design" section to vary design features
   and output the important performance results of that design.  It is currently
   setup to vary the hub radius, shroud radius and the outlet passage width in 3
   WHILE loops.  There are built in maximum and minimum values to constrain each
   but the number of points each is varied within these bounds can be adjusted
   using the "Number of Steps in Design Studies" variable at the bottom.  There
   is also an option to vary the number of blades.  The "Inlet Condition Study"
   can be used to see the effects of reducing the temperature and pressure closer
   to the critical point (and through it), however it will most likely cause REFPROP 
   errors and is still under construction.

4) Save this file.  Be careful not to overwrite other important files.  The 
   executable will only read the "CompressorDimensions.txt" file.  It is recommended
   that you save a backup file just in case.

5) Run the executable file called "CCMD.exe" in the main folder.  This will run the
   performance calculations and create an output file when the analysis is finished!

                              IMPORTANT NOTES

> DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE VALUES (or the title bar).  This is very 
  important or the executable will not read the values properly.  The length of 
  the number after the "|" does not matter. 

> Total Temperature and total pressure MUST have a decimal value.  So remember
  to put .0 after the value if you are using an integer value.

> Currently, you may only enable one option at a time.

> A number of "Error Checking" options were added to determine if there were issues
  with convergence, calling REFPROP with invalid properties, etc.  It is recommended
  to keep this set to 0 when doing any design optimization to speed up the analyis 
  and ensure the code does not crash.  But the error checking can be used to determine
  if there were any issues.  A good design should not have any.

> If there are issues in the diffuser (efficiency is increasing, refprop errors, etc.)
  then try changing the "Number of steps in the diffuser analysis".  A good estimate
  for number of steps is around 50, but it depends on the size of the compressor.

> If an error related to REFPROP exists, most likely the inputs include a design 
  which is no good.  The error message may tell you what happened 
  (i.e. HSFLSH did not converge).  Check the REFPROP manual for more information 
  on REFPROP errors(text file is included in the folder).
